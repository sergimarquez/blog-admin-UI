# Blog Admin UI (Responsive Front-End Design)

This design emulates the admin panel of a Blog site.

The goal of this project is to use the multiple options of the Bootstrap framework to create a functional design. I built most elements with Bootstrap predefined classes (instead of using custom ones). 

It's possible to navigate through the different options of the website, although there's no Back-End functionalities.
