# Blog Admin UI (Responsive Front-End Design)

This design emulates the admin panel of a Blog site.

The goal of this project was to ude the multiple options of the Bootstrap framework to create a functional design. That's why almost all the elements have been created with the Bootstrap predefined classes (instead of using custom ones). 

It's possible to navigate through the different options of the website, although there's no Back-End functionalities.
